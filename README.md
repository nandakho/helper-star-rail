## Description
This project is still in **development!**
Helper Star Rail is a tool built with the Ionic-Angular framework, designed to assist players \(mostly for those who care about numbers\) in \"Honkai Star Rail\".  
This project aims to provide various helpful tools to enhance the gaming experience for players.  
And yes, I do re-use the template I made for [Tools of Fantasy](https://github.com/nandakho/tools-of-fantasy) because it saves so much time xD  

Currently, the project offers the following tools:  
- **Damage Calculator**: This tool can helps players calculate damage output from a certain scenario.  API project for this calculator is made by mkahfi229 (a.k.a. Arucy) and [can be found here](https://github.com/mkahfi229/hsr-calculator)  
- **Effect Hit Rate Calculator**: This tool can helps players calculate what is the chance to land an effect on enemy or calculate how many effect hit rate stat is needed to guarantee applying effect based on a certain scenario.  Same API is used for this calculator, made by mkahfi229 (a.k.a. Arucy) and [can be found here](https://github.com/mkahfi229/hsr-calculator)  
- **Suggestion?**: Open an issue for feature request, if it's possible I might add it..  

More tools will be added in future updates to further enhance the functionality and usability of the project.
